# Punycode Decoder/Encoder Component

Component to decode a Unicode domain into its [Punycode](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode) representation and visa-versa.

Ideally, you should install use the playbook described [here](https://github.com/ThreatConnect-Inc/threatconnect-playbooks/tree/master/playbooks/punycode-decode-encode/) (which requires a custom app to be installed). Only use this component if you cannot install custom apps. Also, be aware that this component uses an API which is not ThreatConnect supported and may break/disappear without warning.
