# VirusTotal Malware Download

Download a file from VirusTotal into a document in ThreatConnect.

To use this component:

- Download it
- Import it into ThreatConnect
- Open the "HTTP Client 1" app and remove and readd a `apikey` query parameter with the VirusTotal API key you would like to use (you can use keychain variables by typing `$`).
- Open the "Create ThreatConnect Document 1" app and type "TCinfected" into the "Vault Password" field. If you would like to use a different password, that's fine, but if you do you will have to change the "Password" field in the "Compress File 1" app to the same password.

You're done! Now all you have to do is create a playbook with this component in it and pass a file hash to the component.
