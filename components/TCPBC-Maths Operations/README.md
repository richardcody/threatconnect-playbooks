# Perform Maths Operation

Perform a maths operation using [mathjs](https://api.mathjs.org/).

**Note:** Mathjs returns numbers larger than 100,000 in scientific notation. If you need to add or subtract and get a result that is **not** in scientific notation, you can use the addition/subtraction component [here](https://github.com/ThreatConnect-Inc/threatconnect-playbooks/tree/master/components/TCPBC-Addition%20Subtraction).
