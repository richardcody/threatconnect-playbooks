This app (IMAP Client) will connect over to a specified host with the username/password configured within the app over port 993. 

When successful the emails retrieved will be output as a StringArray and the messages will be marked as read so that they are not pulled again on any other runs. 

Included is the packages binary (IMAP Client.tcx), the AppBuilder project (IMAP Client.abx) and a playbook (Get and Parse Emails from IMAP.pbx) that will process the emails that were retrieved to show the use case (processing phishing email).
